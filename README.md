# Last Day

Export all **Day One** entries (as markdown files) and some attachments (photos, audio, and PDFs).  

## Why

Day One is a great tool, but over time it's become less flexible for my needs. Unfortunately, the export options they provide are not very useful, if you want to transfer your notes to a different tool. 

## Dependencies

- Day One installed
- zsh
- sqlite3
